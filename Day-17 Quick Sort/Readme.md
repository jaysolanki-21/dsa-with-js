# Quick Sort

A simple implementation of the **Quick Sort** algorithm â€” a fast, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.

## ðŸš€ Overview

Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort elements. This repository provides a clear and concise implementation of Quick Sort in [YOUR_LANGUAGE].

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Select a *pivot* element.
2. Partition the array so that:
   - Elements less than the pivot go to the left.
   - Elements greater than the pivot go to the right.
3. Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays.

**Average Time Complexity**: O(n log n)  
**Worst Time Complexity**: O(nÂ²) (when pivot is poorly chosen)
