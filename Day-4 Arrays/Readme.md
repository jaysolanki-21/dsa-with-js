## 📅 Day 4 - Arrays

---

### 📥 Accepting Input and Basic Operations

---

#### 📝 Accept Values from User into an Array

**Description**: Take array length and values as input from the user and store them in an array.

- **Input**: Array length and individual elements.
- **Output**: Display the final array.

---

#### ➕ Sum of All Elements in an Array

**Description**: Calculate the sum of all elements in a given array.

- **Input**: An array of numbers.
- **Output**: Sum of all elements.

---

### 🔍 Searching and Comparing

---

#### 🏆 Maximum Element in an Array

**Description**: Find and print the maximum element in an array.

- **Input**: An array of numbers.
- **Output**: The maximum number from the array.

---

#### 🥈 Second Maximum Element in an Array

**Description**: Find and print the second largest element in an array.

- **Input**: An array of numbers.
- **Output**: The second largest number from the array.

---

### 🔄 Array Manipulation (Two Pointer Algorithm Used 🧠)

---

#### 🔁 Reverse an Array

**Description**: Reverse the order of elements in an array using the Two Pointer Algorithm.

- **Logic**: Use two pointers `i` (start) and `j` (end), and swap values while moving them towards each other.
- **Input**: An array.
- **Output**: The reversed array.

---

#### 🔃 Move All Zeros to Left and Ones to Right

**Description**: Reorganize an array to move all 0s to the left and all 1s to the right using the Two Pointer Algorithm.

- **Logic**: Use two pointers `i` and `j`. Whenever you find a 0 at `j`, swap it with the value at `i` and increment `i`. Continue until the end.
- **Input**: An array containing only 0s and 1s.
- **Output**: Modified array with all 0s on the left and 1s on the right.

## 🔗 How to Run

1. Install `prompt-sync` for input-based files:
   ```bash
   npm install prompt-sync
2. Run your JavaScript files using Node:

   ```bash
   node filename.js
