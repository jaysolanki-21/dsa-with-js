## 1. üîç Divisors of a Number

**Problem:**  
Given an integer `n`, find and print all its divisors.

**Description:**  
A number `d` is a divisor of `n` if `n % d == 0`. To optimize the solution, iterate only up to the square root of `n`, as every divisor below the square root has a corresponding divisor above it. This reduces time complexity from O(n) to O(‚àön). Special care is taken to avoid duplicate printing when `n` is a perfect square.

## 2. üîó GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)

**Problem:**  
Given two numbers `a` and `b`, find their greatest common divisor (GCD).

**Description:**  
Two common methods are implemented:
- **Type 1 (Euclidean Algorithm using Modulo):** Repeatedly replace `a` with `b`, and `b` with `a % b`, until `b` becomes 0. The result is the GCD.
- **Type 2 (Euclidean Algorithm using Subtraction):** Repeatedly subtract the smaller number from the larger until both numbers are equal. The result is the GCD.

## 3. üî¢ Prime Number Sieve

**Problem:**  
Find all prime numbers up to a given number `n`.

**Description:**  
Uses the **Sieve of Eratosthenes**, a classic algorithm to efficiently find all primes less than or equal to `n`. Initially, all numbers are marked as prime. Starting from 2, mark all multiples of each prime as non-prime. This algorithm runs in O(n log log n) time and is ideal for generating primes in bulk.
