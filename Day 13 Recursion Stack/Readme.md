# DSA With JS - Day 10: Recursion & Stack Visualization

This repository includes beginner-friendly problems that introduce **recursion** and help visualize the **JavaScript call stack**. These problems are part of a daily coding series designed to strengthen your understanding of JavaScript and core Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) concepts.

## üìÖ Day 10 - Recursion & Stack Visualization

### üßæ Questions Covered

1. ### üî¢ Sum up to N using Recursion
   - **Description:** Calculates the sum of all natural numbers up to a given number `n` using a recursive function.
   - **Concepts Used:** Base case, recursive case, backtracking through the call stack.
   - **Expected Output:** Returns the total sum from 1 to `n`.

2. ### ‚ú¥Ô∏è Factorial of N using Recursion
   - **Description:** Computes the factorial of a number using recursive calls.
   - **Concepts Used:** Factorial definition, recursion tree, call stack depth.
   - **Expected Output:** Returns the factorial value of `n`.

3. ### üåÄ Fibonacci Series using Recursion
   - **Description:** Prints the Fibonacci series up to `n` terms using recursion with helper parameters.
   - **Concepts Used:** Parameterized recursion, stack flow, recursive series generation.
   - **Expected Output:** Displays the Fibonacci sequence in proper order.

4. ### üî£ Sum of Digits using Recursion
   - **Description:** Calculates the sum of the digits of a number using recursion.
   - **Example:** For `n = 123`, it computes `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
   - **Concepts Used:** Modulus and integer division, recursive digit extraction, call stack processing.
   - **Expected Output:** Returns the sum of individual digits in the number.

5. ### üîÅ Reverse Number using Recursion
   - **Description:** Reverses a number using recursive logic.
   - **Example:** For `n = 123`, it returns `321`.
   - **Concepts Used:** Place value reversal using modulus and multiplication, recursive step-by-step digit construction.
   - **Expected Output:** Returns the reversed number.

## üìö Learning Focus

- Understanding the structure of recursive functions  
- Visualizing how the **call stack** builds and collapses  
- Differentiating between **base cases** and **recursive cases**  
- Tracking how data flows during recursive execution  
- Gaining insight into time complexity of naive recursive solutions

## üìå Key Takeaways

- Recursion simplifies problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems.
- Every recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack until a base case is reached.
- Stack visualization helps debug and trace recursive logic more effectively.
- Some problems (like Fibonacci) can be optimized further using **memoization** or **iteration**.

## üîó How to Practice

1. Choose one of the described problems.
2. Implement the logic in a JavaScript file using `node` for execution.
3. Add `console.log()` or use the browser debugger to visualize the call stack.
