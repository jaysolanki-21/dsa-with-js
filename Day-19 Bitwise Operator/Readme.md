# DSA With JS - Day 12: Bitwise Operators ðŸ”¢

This day focused on exploring **bitwise operators** in JavaScript. Bitwise operations are performed on binary representations of numbers and are commonly used in low-level programming, performance optimizations, and bit manipulation problems in DSA.

| Operator | Name            | Description                                       |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `&`      | AND             | Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1            |
| `|`      | OR              | Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1       |
| `^`      | XOR             | Sets each bit to 1 if only one bit is 1          |
| `~`      | NOT             | Inverts all the bits                             |
| `<<`     | Left Shift      | Shifts bits to the left, filling with 0s         |
| `>>`     | Right Shift     | Shifts bits to the right, preserving sign        |
