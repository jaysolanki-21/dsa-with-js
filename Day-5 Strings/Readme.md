## 📅 Day 5 - Strings

### 📖 What I Learned

- 📌 **String**: A sequence of characters used for storing text data.

- 📌 **String Operations**: Common operations such as reversing, checking for palindromes, and character manipulation.

## 📥 String Operations and Basic Functions

### 📝 Print Each Character on a New Line
**Description**: Take a string input from the user and print each character on a separate line.  
**Input**: A single string.  
**Output**: Characters printed line by line.

---

### 🔁 Print String in Reverse Order
**Description**: Print the characters of a string in reverse order.  
**Input**: A string.  
**Output**: The reversed string.

---

### 🔄 Check if String is Palindrome
**Description**: Check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).  
**Input**: A string.  
**Output**: `"String is palindrome"` or `"String is not palindrome"`.

---

### 🔃 Toggle Each Character in the String
**Description**: Toggle the case of each character in the string. Convert uppercase to lowercase and vice versa.  
**Input**: A string.  
**Output**: A new string with toggled characters.

---

### 🔢 Frequency of Each Character in a String
**Description**: Count the frequency of each character in the string and return the result.  
**Input**: A string.  
**Output**: An object with character-frequency pairs.

## 🔗 How to Run

1. Install `prompt-sync` for input-based files:
   ```bash
   npm install prompt-sync
2. Run your JavaScript files using Node:

   ```bash
   node filename.js
